# Readium Speech

Readium Speech is a TypeScript library for implementing a read aloud feature with Web technologies. It follows [best practices](https://github.com/HadrienGardeur/read-aloud-best-practices) gathered through interviews with members of the digital publishing industry.

While this project is still in a very early stage, it is meant to power the read aloud feature for two different Readium projects: [Readium Web](https://readium.org/guided-navigation) and [Thorium](https://thorium.edrlab.org/).

Readium Speech was spun out as a separate project in order to facilitate its integration as a shared component, but also because of its potential outside of the realm of ebook reading apps.

## Scope

* Extracting [Guided Navigation objects](https://readium.org/guided-navigation) from a document (or a fragment of a document)
* Generating utterances from these Guided Navigation objects
* Processing utterances (prepending/appending text to utterances based on context, pronunciation through SSML/PLS…)
* Voice selection
* TTS playback
* Highlighting

## Current focus

For our initial work on this project, we're focusing on voice selection based on [recommended voices](https://github.com/HadrienGardeur/web-speech-recommended-voices).

The outline of this work has been explored in a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/HadrienGardeur/web-speech-recommended-voices/discussions/9) and through a [best practices document](https://github.com/HadrienGardeur/read-aloud-best-practices/blob/main/voice-selection.md).

It's currently [under review in a draft PR](https://github.com/readium/speech/pull/7).


## Demo

[A live demo](https://panac.github.io/readium-speech/demo/) of the voice selection API is available.

It demonstrates the following features:

- fetching a list of all available languages, translating them to the user's locale and sorting them based on these translations
- returning a list of voices for a given language, grouped by region and sorted based on quality
- filtering languages and voices based on gender and offline availability
- using embedded test utterances to demo voices
